## Acknowledgments ##

This version of 5G testbed demo was possible by merging open-source projects: 

- [Open5Gs](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs "Open5Gs")

- [UERANSIM](https://github.com/aligungr/UERANSIM "UERANSIM")

- [VPN Over TLS ](https://github.com/dmitriykuptsov/vpn_over_tls "vpn_over_tls")

# 5G PQ TLS Tunnel

## Project Description ##
This project involves deploying a 5G network simulation using Open5GS and UERANSIM and establishing a secure communication tunnel using post-quantum (PQ) certificates with TLS as shown in the figure below.

## Getting started ##
This project consists of several steps based on building several projects to deploy a secure communication within a 5G testbed. All the instructions are going to be found in [Deployment and Setup](Setup/README.md)
